> A configurable createReducer factory for adding custom reducer enhancers.

A configurable createReducer factory (i.e. it is a factory for making a createReducer function) that allows projects to insert utility functions (enhancers) before and after individual reducers are invoked, providing a clear reducer API.

Meant to be used underneath redux's `combineReducers`; use `combineReducers` for reducer composition, and `createReducer` for your action-handling reducers.

Multiple configurations of `createReducerFactory` allows different reducers to use only the utilities or transformers that apply to them, without significant noise in each individual reducer.

NOTE: Obviously, reducers must still be pure, and reducer enhancers should have no side effects.

Enhancers are for logic that should happen within each reducer, but can't happen at the store level, because the store is only responsible for maintaining the top-level state object and invoking the root reducer. Specifically this was written to fulfill two needs: firstly to meld partially hydrated object state (from local storage) with any missing properties from initialState, and secondly to provide helpful runtime logging and validation for myself and other developers new to working with redux & pure reducers. Rather than lump these two totally different tasks together into one reducerFactory, it made sense to break it apart into a configurable module.

Use enhancers to perform transformations (not mutations!) or validations on state before and after handing them to the reducer.

## installation

```
@todo npm install or whatever
```

## usage

### createReducerFactory(beforeReduceEnhancers, afterReduceEnhancers)
`=> Function` Returns a reducer creator function with enhancements.

Expects `beforeReduceEnhancers` and `afterReduceEnhancers` to be arrays of enhancer functions with the signature below. Enhancers are invoked in array order before and after the reducer invocation with the following parameters:
#### beforeEnhancer(handler, initialState, previousState, chainedEnhancedState)
`=> enhancedState` Returns enhanced state, which will be passed as `enhancedPreviousState` to the next enhancer in the chain.

`previousState` will get the original previous state for this dispatch; `chainedEnhancedState` will get the latest state from the enhancer chain.
#### afterEnhancer(handler, initialState, enhancedPreviousState, chainedEnhancedState)
`=> enhancedState` Returns enhanced state, which will be passed as `chainedEnhancedState` to the next enhancer in the chain.

`chainedEnhancedState` will get the latest next state from the enhancer chain.

`enhancedPreviousState` will get the (enhanced) state before action handling.

Enhancers are given the handler function for the dispatched action in case they want to parse it, or if they need to change enhancements based on whether there is a handler.

### configure

Somewhere in your project utilities, add a module that configures the reducer factory:

```
// File: e.g. utils/createReducer.js

// import the reducer-enhancer library:
import createReducerFactory from 'redux-reducer-factory';

// import any enhancers you desire, for example:
import meldPartialState from 'redux-reducer-meld';
import { reducerBotBefore, reducerBotAfter } from 'redux-reducer-bot';

// set up before/after enhancers:
const beforeReduce = [
	meldPartialState
];
const afterReduce = [];

if (__DEV__) {
	beforeReduce.push(reducerBotBefore);
	afterReduce.push(reducerBotAfter);
}

// then create and export your reducer creators:
export default createReducerFactory(beforeReduce, afterReduce);
```


### createReducer(initialState, actionHandlers)
`=> Function`
Returns an enhanced reducer function that directs actions to the appropriate handler based on type and provides initialState.

#### initialState
The reducer's initial domain state. Any native JavaScript object, including ES6 collections.

Note: currently no support for Immutable.js.

#### actionHandlers
A plain object with action types as keys, and handler functions as values.


```
// File: e.g. reducers/fooReducer.js
import createReducer from '../utils/createReducer';

const initialState = {
	foo: 'bar',
    foos: 'ball'
};

const actionhandlers = {
	FOO_ACTION_TYPE: (state, action) => Object.assign({}, state, { foo: action.payload })
};

export default createReducer('foo', initialState, actionHandlers);
```

Or, to use action type constants, use the computed property syntax:
```
import { UPDATE_FOO } from '../constants';
const actionHandlers = {
    [UPDATE_FOO]: (state, action) => ({ foo: action.payload })
}

```

### without configuration

This module also exports a plain createReducer function that uses no enhancers.
```
import { createReducer } from 'redux-reducer-factory';

export default createReducer('foo', initialState, actionHandlers);
```
